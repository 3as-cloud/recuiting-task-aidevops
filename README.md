# Recruiting Task: Automated Booking Compliance Checker Using Agentic AI Workflow Tools / Framework

## Objective

Evaluate the candidate's ability to:

- Utilize agentic AI workflow tools / framework to process and analyze data.
- Implement automation for monitoring and notification.
- Prepare a webhook call from an AI workflow to notify engineers for non compliant bookings.

## Task Description

You are provided with:

- **Booking Data**: A list of consulting bookings in CSV format: `bookings.csv`
- **Booking Guidelines**: A document outlining the policies and standards for bookings for a specific customer Alpha Edge: `booking_guideline_alpha_edge.md`

**Your task is to:**

1. **Data Analysis**:

   - Use agentic AI workflow tools / framework to import and parse the booking data.
   - Review each booking of alpha edge project against the booking guidelines.
   - Identify any bookings that are non-compliant or have discrepancies.

2. **Automation Workflow**:

   - Develop an AI workflow that automates the above review process.
   - Ensure the workflow can be scheduled or triggered as needed.

3. **Notification Preparation**:

   - Prepare a webhook call within the AI workflow to send a message when non-compliant bookings are detected. You can imagine the webhook interface yourself or check slack or teams for specifications.
   - The message should include:
     - Details of the non-compliant bookings.
     - A brief explanation of the compliance issues.

## Technical Requirements

- **Agentic AI Workflow Tools**: Utilize tools that support agentic AI workflows (e.g., LangChain, GPT-4 Agents).

   - Ensure that the code is well-documented with comments explaining key sections.

3. **Documentation**:

   - A **README** file including:
     - Overview of your solution.
     - Instructions on how to set up and run the AI workflow.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Proficiency**:
  - Accuracy in data processing and compliance checking.
  - Effective use of agentic AI workflow tools.

- **Automation Skills**:
  - Efficiency and reliability of the AI workflow.
  - Ability to schedule or trigger the workflow appropriately.

- **Integration Capabilities**:
  - Successful preparation of a webhook call from the AI workflow.
  - Clarity of the notification message content.

- **Code Quality**:
  - Readability and organization of code or configurations.
  - Use of best practices within the AI workflow tools.

- **Documentation and Communication**:
  - Clarity and completeness of the documentation.
